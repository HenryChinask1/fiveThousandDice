            <p style="margin-left: 25px;">OBJECTIVE:</p>
            Be the first player to score 5,000 points!<br>
            Roll 5 dice and earn points by collecting three of a kind, 1's and 5's.<br>
            Once a player reaches 5,000 points, each player gets one last turn to try and earn the top score.<br>
            -----------<br>
            <p style="margin-left: 25px;">COUNTERS:</p>
            Points are obtained through counters.<br>
            Counters are:<br>
            1's / 5's / Any 3 of a kind<br>
            -----------<br>
            <p style="margin-left: 25px;">SCORING:</p>
            1 = 100pts each or 1,000pts for three,<br>
            5 = 50pts each or 500pts for three,<br>
            3 of a kind = *00pts (200 - 600)<br>
            -----------<br>
            <p style="margin-left: 25px;">ADDITIONAL:</p>
            You must initially score 350 points to add a score to the board, then you can score at any time.<br>
            You must save at least one counter to continue rolling. i.e. save at least one scoring die from your current roll to continue.<br>
            If your roll is 1, 2, 2, 3, 4.. you can save both 2's to try for a third. But, you also have to save the 1 to roll again.<br>
            If your next roll is 1, 2, 2, 5, 6 because you saved 1, 2, 2; then your current score is 150 and you have to keep 1, 2, 2, 5 to roll again.<br>
            If you roll no counters ('garbage'), your turn is over and you lose your points accumulated in that turn.<br>
            If all five dice are counters, you can continue increasing your score by rerolling all five dice again.<br>
