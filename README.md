# fiveThousandDice
# A dice game.

OBJECTIVE:
Be the first player to score 5,000 points!
Roll 5 dice and earn points by collecting three of a kind, 1's and 5's.
Once a player reaches 5,000 points, each player gets one last turn to try and earn the top score.
Play with up to 10 players.
          
COUNTERS:
Points are obtained through counters.
Counters are:
1's,
5's,
Any 3 of a kind.
          
SCORING:
1 = 100pts each or 1,000pts for three,
5 = 50pts each or 500pts for three,
3 of a kind = *00pts (200 - 600)

ADDITIONAL:
You must initially score 350 points to add a score to the board, then you can score at any time.
You must save at least one counter to continue rolling. i.e. save at least one scoring die from your current roll to continue.
    If your roll is 1, 2, 2, 3, 4.. you can save both 2's to try for a third. But, you also have to save the 1 to roll again.
    If your next roll is 1, 2, 2, 5, 6 because you saved 1, 2, 2; then your current score is 150 and you have to keep 1, 2, 2, 5 to roll again.
If you roll no counters ('garbage'), your turn is over and you lose your points accumulated in that turn.
If all five dice are counters, you can continue increasing your score by rerolling all five dice again.
